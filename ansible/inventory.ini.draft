1. Use `ansible-vault edit` to open your "inventory.ini" file and copy its content here, overwriting the existing content.
2. Run `python inventory.ini.example_generator.py` to generate the anonymized "inventory.ini.example" file.

For productivity reasons, I have included relevant tasks in .vscode/tasks.json file.
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Tasks: Run Task` to see the available tasks.
