# I have configured a Vagrantfile to test this role.
#
# Create the VM with the following command in the same directory as the Vagrantfile:
# vagrant up
#
# This should create a VM and run the test playbook.
# If successfully run, you can run the following command to log into the VM:
#
# vagrant ssh
#
# Then run the following command to see the version of Docker installed:
# docker --version
#
# If you run into any issues, adjust the network device and the IP address in the Vagrantfile and the inventory file.
#
# While the VM is running, you can run the playbook with the following command in the same directory as the Vagrantfile:
# ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=../../ ansible-playbook -i inventory test.yml
#
# Or you can run the following command to run the playbook in the VM:
# vagrant provision
#
# When you are done, you can run the following command to destroy the VM:
# vagrant destroy -f
#
# tests file for docker
